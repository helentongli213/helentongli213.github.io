            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Problem:</span> How may we use cultural probes to generate thoughtful, insightful products that engender conversations regarding modern society and culture?</p>

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Solution:</span> People tend to justify their excessive use of photo-based social media (ie. Instagram) with the phrase "a picture is worth a thousand words." In other words, an Instagram account with 50 photos must be worth 50,000 words, thus painting a deep and intimate picture of the account owner. However, the careful curation and editing involved in social media seems to refute this, instead insinuating shallowness and lack of genuinity. TheBox aims to illustrate this phenomenon by condensing one's social media persona, supposedly worth thousands of words, into five simple objects in a simple box, forcing the user to come to terms with his or her online identity.</p>

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Ideation:</span> We began by conducting two cultural probes on college students who use Instagram. In our first probe, we gave subjects a previously-unseen photograph and asked them to provide a written, journal-like response to the photo and the reactions it evoked. In our second probe, we asked our subjects to choose a random photo from their own photo library, edit it as though they were going to post on social media, and provide reasoning as to why they made certain edits. With these two probes, we hoped to draw a comparison between a viewer's impression of another's social media content with one's perception of his or her own online persona.</p>
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/probes.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img" id="probes">

            <p class="work-section-text">After collecting these probes, we created generalized insights regarding the topic of social media. Then, we took these insights, compared them with one another, and categorized them based on topic. We noticed that the majority of our subjects, when commenting on another previously-unknown photo, could generate deep and insightful commentary on their reactions. However, when commenting on their own edited photographs, subjects usually strayed from delving into more intimate topics and simply alluded to surface-level reasoning like wanting skin to appear clear, wanting to highlight certain parts of the photograph, etc. Thus, we hypothesized a significant decrease in intimacy when interacting with one's own social media content, consequently forming a shallow picture of the self in the virtual world.</p>
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/insights.JPG" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img" id="insights">

            <p class="work-section-text">As a result, our ideation process heavily reflected a focus on intimate commentary of one's own social media usage and its effects. We aimed to create products that catalyzed introspection and thought regarding the current social media space. One idea included an auto-editor that adjust lighting, saturation, etc. on a photograph to make it more stereotypically "desirable," thus making the user conform his or her identity to social media norms. Another potential product was a social media platform with photo-based comments rather than text-based ones, giving the user more freedom in self-expression, but also anxiety regarding interpretation of others' thoughts.  </p>
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/autoedits.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img ideation-img" id="auto-edits">
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/commenting.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img ideation-img" id="commenting">

            <p class="work-section-text">However, we found that the majority of our ideas were so hypothetically realistic that the reactions they generated failed to reach our expectations of introspection and self-reflection. So, we made the risky decision to stray away from a more consumer-focused, realistic product and moved toward absurdism. Ultimately, we decided on a design concept like theBox because its hypothetical, absurdist nature afforded more opportunities for conversation regarding virtual identities and social media personas.</p>

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Implementation:</span> A significant amount of time implementing theBox was devoted to fleshing out the procedure itself. We decided to use Instagram as a social media platform because it had a permanent, usually-curated set of photos that could easily be downloaded. We would take the user's Instagram photos, run them through a reverse image search with a pre-existing Google API, and generate a list of corresponding nouns. Then, we would take this list of nouns and send them to the user's social media connections, asking them to vote on the top five nouns they thought corresponded best with the account owner. We would finally acquire the resulting top-five nouns (or a representation of them), place them in a nondescript box, and send them to the user, effectively condensing his or her social media persona into five things.</p>
            
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/1.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img process-img" id="1">
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/2.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img process-img" id="2">
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/3.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img process-img" id="3">
            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/4.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img process-img" id="4">

            <p class="work-section-text">Using the procedure above, we prototyped the process with my own Instagram account. We formatted the list of nouns into a Google Forms survey, and I put forth a public call on my Facebook asking for "friends" to respond. After receiving over 50 responses, we took the top five nouns and either found their actual physical forms or lasercut miniature representations when certain nouns were too abstract or simply impractical (ie. "female" was a lasercut Venus symbol on a piece of wood). </p>

            <img src = "assets/images/thebox/three-phone.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img personal-img" id="3">

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Conclusion:</span> We presented our final project at the Jacobs Hall Spring 2018 Design Showcase to students and faculty, where we also provided the final box of items generated when prototyping with my own personal Instagram account. Our project was lauded for its innovative approach to such an open-ended prompt and our risky decision to create a hypothetical, absurdist product.</p>
