            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Problem:</span> While many tools exist that address sleep issues and conditions, few of them are holistic and general-audience-focused. We aimed to create a product that could provide multiple solutions for all kinds of sleepers. </p>

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Solution:</span> Cloud Z is a "smart-blanket" that connects to your smartphone via BlueTooth. The Cloud Z blanket contains a grid-like system of wires that, when initiated by the user via a mobile application, can heat the blanket, set vibrating alarms, and more. The Cloud Z blanket is also customizable for single and co-sleepers, allowing partners to select their own preferences for temperature, volume, and weight.</p>

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Method:</span> We began by addressing various problems encountered in sleep that ranged in intensity from chronic to annoying. We categorized these problems and used them to conduct a product landscape on currently-available sleep products. Based on our product landscape, we notice that there was an absence of a holistic sleep product that could be applicable to multiple users. Thus, we decided on a product that could address multiple problems and provide various solutions, all customization available via mobile application.</p>

            <img src = "assets/images/cloudz/sketch.png" class="responsive-img non-link-img landscape-img" id="sketch">

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Implementation:</span> Through MarvelApp, we implemented a prototype of the Cloud Z blanket's mobile application. Tools include temperature regulation of the blanket, alarms with options for both sound and vibration, and even a REM sleep calculator to automatically set an alarm that gives the user optimal sleep. We prioritized a design that mimicked that of the Apple iPhone to create as intuitive of an experience as possible. We accomplished this with similar scroll-bars, alarm interfaces, and switches to create a seamless, calming UI appropriate for a sleep-related product. </p>

            <p class="work-section-text"><span>Conclusion:</span> We presented our final project at the Jacobs Hall Fall 2017 Design Showcase to students and faculty, including our MarvelApp prototype as well as a model of the wire grid system that would be meshed within the blanket. We were lauded for taking a holistic approach to solving our design problems as well as our MarvelApp prototype. </p>
