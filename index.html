			<div id = "about-text"> In case you didn't know already, my name is Helen Li. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley intending to major in Cognitive Science as well as minor in Computer Science. Specifically, my interests fall into human-computer interaction and human-centered design, though I also enjoy providing a voice in computer science education. Outside of school, my passions include creative writing, dancing, and traveling to new places. Click the button below for a more comprehensive resume.</div>

					<div id = "parttwo">As an assistant instructor for the Video Game Design and MOD Design with Minecraft majors, I was responsible for knowing my lead instructor's needs ahead of time, maintaining classroom conduct in a weekly-changing group of 5th-8th graders, and fostering a passion for computer design in youth. I also took on additional responsibilities like substituting for my lead instructor when he was absent, introducing other outlets of CS exploration unmentioned in the curriculum, and providing mentorship to younger students to encourage them not only in their CS education, but in their development as innovators and creators. Working at Galileo Summer Quest allowed me to combine my passions of computer science and youth education while providing me with opportunities to grow professionally.</div>
