			<div id = "about-text"> My name is Helen Li, and I'm currently a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in Computer Science, pursuing the Design Innovation Certificate. Specifically, my interests fall into human-computer interaction, screen-based design, and UI/UX design. I'm currently the publicity officer for Berkeley ANova as well as a social media advisor for the UC Berkeley Social Media Team. Outside of these activities, my passions include creative writing, dancing, and youth education. Click the link below for a more comprehensive resume.</div>

					<div id = "partone"> ANova is a student organization dedicated to improving computer science education in under-resourced communities across the Bay Area. Members go on weekly visits to middle and high schools to mentor young students in computer science. Every semester, ANova also hosts ANova Hacks, a 10-hour hackathon for high school students to come together and create interesting and unique projects.  </div>
					<div id = "parttwo">As the publicity officer of Berkeley ANova, my primary responsibility includes leading a committee of six club members in providing design, social media, and historian services to the organization. I also opened up opportunities for my committee members to grow professionally through personally-led design and marketing workshops, resume reviews, and portfolio assistance. My responsibilities outside my committee members include designing for larger events like recruitment and ANova Hacks as well as collaborating with other officers in terms of ANova's presence both on and off campus. </div>

These both reached an audience of over 5,000 for every post. Additionally, I interviewed various UC Berkeley staff for the #BerkeleyMinds campaign, assisted in writing and publicizing for our #CALoween event, and worked with other Social Slice members to implement student-specific events like Cal Day.</div>

					<div id = "parttwo">In the web development team, I worked closely with a group of five other students to completely, from scratch, rewrite The Daily Californian's website. As a team, we were expected to provide a student's perspective on both the website's interface aesthetic and its usability. Several of my personal assignments included re-aligning the website's header, designing a new front page, and providing new documentation to assist any future endeavors to edit the code.</div>
