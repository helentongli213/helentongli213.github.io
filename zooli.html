      			<p>Zoos are a common destination for families enjoying a day out. With the fascinating animals, intriguing learning experiences, and even the occasional shows, zoos have become a staple of the nuclear family. However, visiting the zoo can also be a challenge for large groups. Having to cater to children of varying ages is often tiresome, thus hindering the adults’ experiences as well. Furthermore, zoo visits require extensive planning, a process that can easily be automated. In this way, Zooli steps in by providing a customized plan for any family’s zoo's visit based on varying factors like time of visit, number of children, and more. </p>

      			<p>Acknowledging that it has been quite a while since I visited a zoo, I decided to conduct an interview to better understand the audience I would be designing for. My interviewee, John (whose name has been changed) is in his early thirties and has a wife and two children: Mary and Tyler (names changed). Mary is twelve years-old, and Tyler is seven years-old. I interviewed John about his most recent trip to the Oakland Zoo with his family. I noticed that he referenced his children’s ages a lot, saying, “At one point Mary just wanted to sit and stare at them feeding the otters, but Tyler… well Tyler’s seven, so all he wanted to do was see the biggest animals he could find.” John also mentioned his family’s route throughout the zoo, saying, “Well the zoo, it has a main area and then another place you go to on a gondola. We didn’t know what Mary and Tyler would want to see or eat, so we just ended up riding the gondola like four times back and forth.” John’s interview enlightened me to the various logistical problems involved in planning a zoo trip for multiple people.  </p>

      			<p>I next conducted a product landscape on mobile applications for local zoos. The two applications I focused on were the San Francisco Zoo mobile application and the Oakland Zoo mobile application because these were the only two zoos I had personally visited in the last five years. For either application, I constructed a “plusses and deltas” list to pinpoint how they were relevant to the concerns raised in John’s interview. </p>

      			<p>I took the data gathered from my interview with John and my product landscape to generate various insights that I then organized into two main categories: “path-planning and “catering to many.” By organizing these insights, I eventually decided on a mobile application for a (hypothetical) zoo that could generate a custom route for the visiting family. I knew this application would be heavily dependent on personal customization, so I also used my gathered insights to decide which attributes would be used to generate the different paths through the zoo. </p>

      			<p>I opted to utilize standard iOS designs in my mobile application, making Zooli more intuitive for the user.

      			<p>At the end of the survey, Zooli asks for any special accomodations. This was done in an attempt to cater to as many needs as possible.

There is also an arrow that brings the user to a map of the zoo with the path overlaid. </p>
